When would you want to keep a remote repository rather than keeping it local?
    Saving things on the cloud is always safer than just holding everything locally on one computer. Just in case your computer gets
    bricked, your work is backed up online.  It also makes it easier to collaborate on the same project with multiple people on multiple
    devices.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
    There is always a chance that pulling changes may disrupt your own workflow that you have on your computer.  Pulling changes manually
    gives you more control over situations like that.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
    Fork is a copy of a remote from one github account to another.  Clone is a copy of that remote saved locally on your computer.
    Branches aren't copies of a repo, but more so a split in the commit history that allows you to make changes outside of the master branch
    and merge it back into the master branch when everything is ready.
