When would you want to keep a remote repository rather than keeping it local?
    Saving things on the cloud is always safer than just holding everything locally on one computer. Just in case your computer gets
    bricked, your work is backed up online.  It also makes it easier to collaborate on the same project with multiple people on multiple
    devices.
