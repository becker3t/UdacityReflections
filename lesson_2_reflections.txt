What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
    It creates a git repo locally on your computer.  This can be pointed to an online repository on github in order to save things to the cloud.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
    The staging area acts as a middle man between the local directory and the online repository.  This allows us to have control over what
    files to push to the repository rather than automatically updating every file that gets modified in real time.
